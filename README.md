# Automation With Python Scripts
AUTOMATING WORD DOCUMENT CREATION<br><br>
PROBLEM: The process of repeatedly creating Word files for lab tasks was time-consuming and inefficient. This led to the decision to automate the task using Python scripts, streamlining the workflow and reducing redundancy.<br><br>
Objective:<br>
To create a Word document for a lab task in the "Data Communication and Networks" course, containing personal and course details, and save it to a specified folder.<br><br>
Steps Involved:<br>
Folder Management: The script checks if the folder C:\Users\Hp\Desktop\marium uni work\CodeAlphaDemo exists. If not, it creates the folder automatically.<br>
Word Document Creation: A new Word document is generated using the python-docx library. It includes a heading ("Data Communication and Networks lab task") and paragraphs containing the student's name ("Marium Haris") and student ID ("15084"). <br>
File Naming and Saving: The file is named dcn lab task.docx and is saved to the specified folder.
